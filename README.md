# electron-menubar

A boilerplate for electron menubar application with integration with `React` and `Webpack`. I am using [`menubar`](https://github.com/maxogden/menubar) as a dependency to get cross-platform compatibility. It supports `MacOS`, `Windows`, and `Linux`.

# How to use?

Just clone or fork it, then delete unnecessary files and add your app components.

Run to start app:

```shell
yarn start
```
